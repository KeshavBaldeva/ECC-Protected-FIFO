# ECC-Protected-FIFO
This project implements a 32-bit RAM-based FIFO in Verilog with integrated Hamming SECDED (Single Error Correction, Double Error Detection) Error-Correcting Code (ECC). It ensures reliable and fault-tolerant data storage by detecting and correcting memory errors on-the-fly.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Hamming SECDED ECC integration for error detection and correction.
- Separate ECC Encoder and ECC Decoder modules.
- Supports:
1. Single-bit error correction â†’ Raises sec_err flag.
2. Double-bit error detection â†’ Raises ded_err flag.
- FIFO control logic implemented using read/write pointers with wrap-around addressing.
- Synthesizable and verified using Xilinx Vivado.

## ðŸ”¹ Data Flow

**Write Path**  
Input data (din) â†’ ECC Encoder â†’ Generates 7-bit ECC â†’ Store (32-bit data + 7-bit ECC = 39 bits) into FIFO memory.

**Read Path**  
Fetch 39-bit word from memory â†’ ECC Decoder â†’ Output Register.
Corrects single-bit errors and raises sec_err.  
Detects double-bit errors and raises ded_err.  
Outputs corrected data on dout.
